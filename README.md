CENG477 HW1

CPU Ray-Tracer

Score: 77.0/100.0

This is a C++ Ray Tracer from scratch.

It renders triangles, spheres and triangle-mesh objects in seperate ways using ambient, diffuse and specular shading.

Problems with specular shading of spherical objects. 

Everything except reading the text file including the math calculations was done by me.
